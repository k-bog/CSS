Preface

<textarea rows="2" cols="20" wrap="hard">
The Candidate Scoring System (CSS) is a method for selecting preferred candidates in elections. It is based on Effective Altruist (EA) ethics and methodology. Of course, opposing political positions are still valid in the EA movement and there is room for respectable disagreement.

CSS1 was released in March 2019, establishing basic policy preferences and providing tentative scoring of presidential candidates. For CSS2 we have deepened our analysis of policy questions, gathered more information about political candidates, expanded the number of candidates under consideration, added calculations of election probabilities and counterfactuals, and simplified the information into a single report with an accompanying Excel model.

This project is limited by the constraints of time and manpower against the vast breadth, depth and complexity of the problems that it tackles. Therefore, many arguments and evidence will be missing. This does not mean the project is necessarily wrong or biased, it just means we haven’t yet included as much content and research as we would like to. It is a work in progress and open to input from others. We are uncertain about much of this content, but we minimize hedging language for the sake of readability. If some relevant information is missing, please help us include it – everything here is subject to revision and elaboration.
